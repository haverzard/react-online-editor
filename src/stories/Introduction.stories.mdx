# Welcome to haverzard's Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

In this storybook, you can:
- try a demo version of the online editor
- develop the library as your own
- test/check the library whether it's working intendedly

In the library, there are 3 types of editor:

1. CustomizableEditor: you can customize the editor, whether the theme or how it will run the code

2. ReactEditor: using React and ReactDOM as its dependency, you can render your React code by providing a React ref in the viewer props.

3. VueEditor: using Vue as its dependency, you can render your Vue code by providing an ID to a DOMElement in the viewer props.
